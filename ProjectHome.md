# Introduction #
`googleVis` is an [R](http://www.r-project.org) package providing an interface between R and [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/).
The functions of the package allow the user to visualise data with the Google Chart Tools without uploading their data to Google.

The output of `googleVis` functions is html code that contains the data and references to  `JavaScript` functions hosted by Google. To view the output a browser with Flash and Internet  connection is required, the actual chart is rendered in the browser.

# Examples #
Here is an example of a Motion Chart ([user guide](http://google-motion-charts-with-r.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/vignettes/MotionChart.pdf)) using data from the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.com):

&lt;wiki:gadget url="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7586336/googleVisExamples/WorldBankMotionChartFeb2013.xml" width="550" height="420" border="0"/&gt;

You can achieve the same result with the `googleVis` package and [R](http://www.r-project.org) without placing your data on the web. The function `gvisMotionChart` generates the motion chart locally. Please read Google's [Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/motionchart#Data_Policy) and [Terms of Use](https://developers.google.com/chart/termsl). The above chart is the output of the demo World Bank. This is how it works:
```
library(googleVis)
demo(WorldBank) ## At least version googleVis_0.2.10 required
```
The output of `gvisMotionChart` contains all the data and a reference to the Google Chart Tools. The actual Flash chart is rendered within the browser. Please see also the package [vignette](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleVis/vignettes/googleVis.pdf).

You find more **[googleVis examples](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleVis/vignettes/googleVis_examples.html)** on CRAN and [blog](http://lamages.blogspot.com/search/label/googleVis).

# Motivation #
In 2006 Hans Rosling gave an inspiring talk at [TED](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html) about social and economic developments in the world over the last 50 years, which challenged the views and perceptions of many listeners. Rosling had used extensive data analysis to reach his conclusions.  To visualise his talk, he and his team at [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org) had developed animated bubble charts.

Rosling's presentation popularised the idea and use of interactive charts, and as a result the software behind
Gapminder was bought by Google and integrated as motion charts into their [Visualisation API](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/index) one year later.

Inspired by those talks and the desire to use interactive data visualisation tools to foster the dialogue between data analysts and others the authors of this page started the development of the googleVis package.

# Installation #
In all cases [Flash](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer) and an internet connection is required to view the visualisation output. Of course you also need [R](http://www.r-project.org). R version 3.0.2 or higher is required for googleVis version >= 0.5.0.

If you are new to R and installing add-on packages please read the [R Installation and Administration manual](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html).

### From  [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleVis/) ###
Start R on your computer and type:
```
 install.packages('googleVis')
```
## From Github ##

To install the current development version from Github you need the devtools package and the other packages on which googleVis depends:
```
install.packages(c("devtools","RJSONIO", "knitr", "shiny", "httpuv"))
```
To install googleVis run:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("mages/googleVis")
```
## Using googleVis ##
Please read the [Google Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/chart/terms)  before you use the `googleVis` package.

After you installed the package type into R:
```
 library('googleVis')
```
Type `library(help='googleVis')` or `?googleVis`
to see the overall documentation.  Type `demo(googleVis)` to get an idea of the functionality of the package.

For a brief introduction read the five page [R Journal article](http://google-motion-charts-with-r.googlecode.com/files/RJournal_2011-2_Gesmann%2Bde%7ECastillo.pdf).

----------------------------
Changes

* Fixed minor formatting issues in documentation and vignettes.

* Added examples in demo googleVis to show how to
  customize points and lines and to the help files of
  gvisLineChart and gvisScatterChart.


googleVis 0.5.1 [2014-04-14]
----------------------------
NEW FEATURES

* New functions gvisSankey, gvisAnnotationChart, gvisHistogram,
  gvisCalendar and gvisTimeline to support the new Google charts 
  of the same names (without 'gvis').

* New demo Trendlines showing how trend-lines can be added to
  Scatter-, Bar-, Column-, and Line Charts.

* New demo Roles showing how different column roles can be used
  in core charts to highlight data.

* New vignettes written in R Markdown showcasing googleVis

  instead a link to the online Google API documentation is given. 

* Updated googleVis demo

* All googleVis output will be displayed in your default browser. 
  In previous versions of googleVis output could also be displayed 
  in the preview pane of RStudio. This feature is no 
  longer available with the current version of RStudio, but is likely to   
  be introduced again with the release of RStudio version 0.99 or higher.


googleVis 0.4.7 [2013-11-10]
----------------------------

Changes

* New option 'googleVis.viewer' which controls the default output of
  the googleVis plot method. On package load it is set to 
  getOption("viewer"). It you use RStudio, then its viewer pane will 
  be used for displaying non-Flash charts. 
  Set options("googleVis.viewer"=NULL) and the googleVis
  plot function will open all output in the default browser again.

* The package start-up message makes the user aware of the default 
  viewer option.

* Added example to gvisMap that illustrates how the icon can be 
  changed.


googleVis 0.4.6 [2013-11-03]
----------------------------

Changes

* googleVis will use the Viewer pane in RStudio (version >= 0.98.441) 
  to display non-Flash charts by default. The setting is controlled
  via the option viewer. Set options("viewer"=NULL) and the googleVis
  plot function will open all output in the default browser again.


googleVis 0.4.5 [2013-08-29]
----------------------------

Bug Fixes

* The indentation of some of the HTML output changed in version 0.4.4,
  which as a result stopped googleVis output to be rendered with knitr.


googleVis 0.4.4 [2013-08-23]
----------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* gvisTable() gained new parameter formats, which allow users to 
  specify the format of numbers displayed in a table. 
  Thanks to Jacqueline Buros for providing ideas and code.

* Doughnut charts are now possible as pie charts with a hole.

Changes

* New examples for gvisBarChart, gvisColumnChart, gvisComboChart 
  demonstrating how to change the width of bars

googleVis 0.4.3 [2013-05-25]
----------------------------

NEW FEATURES
 
 * givsGeoChart has a new argument 'hovervar' to specify a column in
   input data that can be used to show additional information in a geo
   chart. See the new example of plotting countries' credit rating in
   the help file for a use case. Thanks to John Muschelli for suggesting
   this feature.


googleVis 0.4.2 [2013-03-16]
----------------------------

NEW FEATURES

 * The core charts (e.g. line, area, bar, column and combo charts)
   accept now also date variables for the x-axis. Thanks to Sebastian
   Campbell for pointing this out.

Changes 

 * The WorldBank demo uses now the WDI package.
   Thanks to John Maindonald for providing the code.

Bug Fixes

 * Fixed typos in Stock and Andrew example data. 
   Thanks to Sebastian Campbell for reporting this issue. 


googleVis 0.4.0 [2013-02-24]
----------------------------

NEW FEATURES
 
 * New function renderGvis to support shiny.
   This function allows user to insert googleVis output into shiny
   apps, similar to renderText and renderPlot. See the help page for
   more details. Many thanks to Joe Cheng for his support and help.

Changes

 * In order to support shiny the order of the elements of the
   gvis*()$html$chart vector changed. The positions of jsChart and
   jsFooter have been swapped.

 * The load mechanism for the Google API changed from http to https
   again. Thanks to Jacques Philip. 

 * The package dependencies changed to imports statements in DESCRIPTION. 
   Thanks to Suraj Gupta for pointing this out.

 * The R.rsp example in demo googleVis has been moved into its own
   demo Rrsp. 

 * A FAQ and shiny section has been added to the vignette.

Bug Fixes

 * jsDisplayChart didn't check if the google visualization function is already
   loaded. Many thanks to Mark Melling for reporting the issue and
   providing a solution.

 * The demo WorldBank didn't download all data but only the first
   12000 records. Many thanks to John Maindonald reported this issue. 


googleVis 0.3.3 [2012-11-12]
----------------------------

Changes

 * Clarified the usage of the argument state in the help file of
   gvisMotionChart. Thanks to Leonardo Trabuco 


googleVis 0.3.3 [2012-10-31]
----------------------------

Bug Fixes

 * plot.gvis didn't open a browser window when options(gvis.plot.tag)
   was not set to NULL, but the user explicitly called plot.gvis with
   tag NULL. Thanks to Sebastian Kranz for reporting this bug. 


googleVis 0.3.2 [2012-10-28]
----------------------------

NEW FEATURES

 * plot.gvis gained the argument 'tag', which works similar to the
   argument of the same name in print.gvis. By default the tag
   argument is NULL and plot.gvis has the same behaviour as in the
   previous versions of googleVis. 
   However, the argument can be set outside plot.gvis via
   options(gvis.plot.tag=...). This allows users to switch plot
   statements into print statements by changing only one setting. This
   is particular useful when googleVis is used in combination with
   knitr or R.rsp. Setting options(plot.gvis.tag="chart") will ensure
   that plot(gvisOutput) statements will be included into the final
   HTML output. See the help file to plot.gvis and vignette for more
   details. 

Changes

 * The tag argument of print.gvis can be set globally from outside the
   function via options(gvis.print.tag)

 * The vignette has a new section describing how to set the
   behaviour of plot.gvis and print.gvis via options(gvis.plot.tag),
   options(gvis.print.tag) respectively. The section describing how
   googleVis can be used with knitr has been extended and an additional
   example included. 

 * plot.gvis can open any html file now, not just gvis-objects. Like
   with gvis-object it will copy the file into a temporary directory
   and display it via the R HTTP server. 


googleVis 0.3.1 [2012-10-22]
----------------------------

Bug Fixes

* The argument 'browser' introduced in version 0.3.0 has been removed
  again. The argument was set by default to the output of
  getOptions('browser'), if interactive() returned TRUE, otherwise to
  'false'. The function getOptions('browser') returns either a string
  or a function call. The later caused an error message, as
  experienced with RStudio and RGui.exe. The check is now handled
  internally by plot.gvis.

  Thanks to Sebastian Kranz for reporting this bug.


googleVis 0.3.0 [2012-10-20]
----------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* plot.gvis has a new argument 'browser'. The argument is passed on
  to the function browseURL. The 'browser' argument is by default set
  based on the output of interactive(). This prevents R CMD CHECK
  trying to open browser windows during the package checking
  process. See the help file of plot.gvis for more details.
  Thanks to Henrik Bengtsson for his comments and suggestions.

* gvisMotionChart has new arguments xvar, yvar, colorvar and
  sizevar. Those arguments are optional and set the various dimensions 
  of a motion chart, similar to those in gvisBubbleChart.
  Thanks to Sebastian Kranz for the idea and initial code.

* gvisGeoChart accepts tooltip.triggers following an update of the
  Visualisation API by Google, 24 September 2012

* R data frames are transformed into JSON objects using a new function 
  provided by Sebastian Kranz and Wei Luo. The new function speeds up 
  the googleVis functions.

Changes

* Changed the load mechanism for the Google API from http to https.
  Thanks to Erik Bülow for pointing this out (Issue 19). 

* Changed example in help file of gvisMap to show how to include html
  code in tooltip. 

Bug Fixes

* Chart editor was not validated properly under XHMTL 1.0 Strict


googleVis 0.2.17 [2012-08-02]
----------------------------

Changes

 * Added sections with information to 'knitr' and 'Rook' to vignette 

 * Added example to gvisMerge demonstrating the use of 'Reduce'

Bug Fixes

 * Data frames with one row only were not displayed in a chart.
   Thanks to Oliver Jay and Wai Tung Ho for reporting this issue.

 * Fixed earth quake example, using data from 
   http://www.iris.edu/seismon/last30.html, 
   Mag was read as factor rather than numeric

googleVis 0.2.16 [2012-06-01]
----------------------------

Changes

 * Updated example in help file of gvisGeoChart for individual colour
   axis 

 * Updated links to Google API pages

NEW FEATURES

   Thanks to Jason Pickering for providing a patch. 

googleVis 0.2.15 [2012-03-04]
----------------------------

Changes

*  Updated documentation following a new version of the Google API
   on 22 February 2012. 
     
*  Moved vignette from folder /inst/doc to /vignettes

NEW FEATURES

*  Quoted from Google
   http://code.google.com/apis/chart/interactive/docs/release_notes.html: 
   - Added gradient color mode to bubble chart.
   - Geo chart:
     o  Region interactivity in marker mode is now disabled by
     	default. How to keep the old behavior? Set the
   	enableRegionInteractivity option to true.

     o  Markers are now opaque by default. How to keep the old
        behaviour? Set the markerOpacity option to 0.5.

     o  Marker size is now between 3 and 12 pixels by default. How to
        keep the old behavior? Set the sizeAxis option to {minSize: 2,
        maxSize: 30}.

     o  A magnifying glass is now opened when the user hovers over
        cluttered markers (excluding IE<=8). How to keep the old
        behaviour? Set the magnifyingGlass option to {enable: false}.

googleVis 0.2.4 [2011-02-07]
---------------------------

Changes

   Ben Bolker for this suggestion and code contribution.  
  
*  plot.gvis no longer requires the web server provided by
   the R.rsp package to display the visualisation output. Instead it
   uses the internal R HTTP help server. Many thanks to John Verzani
   for this suggestion and code contribution. 
  
*  R >= 2.11.0 is required to plot googleVis output, as it uses the
   internal R HTTP help server.

   x$html$chart is a named character vector of the chart's
   JavaScript building blocks and html tags. 

*  print.gvis has a new argument 'tag', which gives the user more
   control over the output
